Fxsnapshot
==========

Capture a set of images from your local token.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Capture *count* images:
```
node fxsnapshot.js <count>
```

The script opens the standard fxhash-webpack-boilerplate url
(http://localhost:8080/). It will work only if you use a canvas and
call fxpreview().
